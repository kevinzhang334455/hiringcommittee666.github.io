Hello World! I am HiringCommittee666 and I am interested in a lot of things like singing,
playing piano, photography, traveling, pools, working out at gym, playing Poker, etc.

As for my work, I am interested in software architecting, distributed systems, GPU, computer architecture,
and low-level (like OS) stuffs. My favortie programming language is C++ and hopefully I can learn some python
for machine learning.
